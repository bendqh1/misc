## Question

I have a digital image of a document.

The document somewhat resembles the document that was photographed in the sense that in a glimpse the document appears as having a White background and Black text.

But, my problem is that the actual background color of the document, after printing it, is Grey.

How could I make the background of the document Whiter and the text on it Blacker, with say, GIMP?

## Answer

To improve the appearance of your document in GIMP by making the background whiter and the text blacker, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Open the Image in GIMP
- Launch GIMP and open the image with your document.

### 2. Convert the Image to Grayscale
This will help you isolate the contrast between the background and text.
- In the menu, go to **Image** → **Mode** → **Grayscale**.
  
### 3. Adjust the Brightness and Contrast
This step will help to brighten the background and darken the text.
- Go to **Colors** → **Brightness-Contrast**.
- Increase the **Brightness** to lighten the background. Try values around +30 to +50, depending on your image.
- Increase the **Contrast** to make the text darker. Start with a value of +50 to +80.
- Click **OK** to apply these changes.
