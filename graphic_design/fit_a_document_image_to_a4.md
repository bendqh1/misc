## Question

Windows 11 Home with GIMP.

How to isolate the document part of a digital image of a printed document on a desk, especially so to print it on a A4 page?

## Answer

Main stages:

1. Crop andor rotate the image.
2. Go to **Image > Scale Image** and set the resolution to **300 DPI** (for printing).
  * Ensure that the width and height are set correctly to fit an A4 page (210 mm x 297 mm or 8.27 inches x 11.69 inches). You can adjust the dimensions under the **Width** and **Height** fields while keeping the aspect ratio intact.
  * If you want to maintain the documentâ€™s proportions, make sure to check the **Lock Aspect Ratio** (the chain icon next to the width and height fields).
