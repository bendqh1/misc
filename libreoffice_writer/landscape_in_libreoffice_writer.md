Windows 11 Home with LibreOffice Writer 25.2.5.2

I am trying to make the page horizontal and so I went to `Format > Page Style > General` and there I chose `Next style: Landscape`.  
I then clicked "Apply" and then "Okay" but the page still appears vertical instead of horizontal.

What have I done wrong?

Choosing **"Next style: Landscape"** only affects the **next page**, not the current one.

To make the **current page** horizontal:

1. Go to `Format > Page Style`.
2. In the **Page Style** dialog, go to the **Page** tab (not General).
3. Under **Orientation**, select **Landscape**.
4. Click **OK**.

This will apply landscape orientation to the current page style.
