In Windows 11 Home the following error appears in every update attempt:

> Your device is missing important security and quality fixes. Make sure to keep your device on and plugged in so updates can complete.

Attempts to solve this problem:

## Run Powershell as Administrator

```powershell
Install-Module PSWindowsUpdate -Force
Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate
```

If asked to install *NuGet* than install it because NuGet is a Microsoft package manager required to download PowerShell modules like `PSWindowsUpdate`. It's safe and necessary in this context.

## Hide a given update

```powershell
Hide-WindowsUpdate -Title "UPDATE_TITLE_COMES_HERE_EXACTLY_AS_WRITTEN"
```

* If getting an error about the lack of ability to run scripts due to to Powershell execution policy, then to  proceed safely temporarily allow scripts for your current session only:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Then run the command to hide the update.

## Confirm result

```powershell
Get-WindowsUpdate -IsHidden
```

Something like this sould be put out:

```
ComputerName Status     KB          Size Title
------------ ------     --          ---- -----
X          -D--H--                14MB UPDATE_TITLE_COMES_HERE_EXACTLY_AS_WRITTEN
```

`-D--H--` means "Declined" and "Hidden".

## Reset Windows update components

Still getting:

> Your device is missing important security and quality fixes. Make sure to keep your device on and plugged in so updates can complete.

```powershell
net stop wuauserv
net stop cryptSvc
net stop bits
net stop msiserver
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old
net start wuauserv
net start cryptSvc
net start bits
net start msiserver
```
