# In laptop with Windows 11 I can adjust screen brightness from Windows. In a desktop with Windows 11 I can't --- should I buy a new screen?

## Question

In laptop with Windows 11 I can adjust screen brightness from Windows but in a desktop with Windows 11 I can't. 

This causes me to get an "eye pain" from a "brightness flash" if I wake up **at night** and then open the desktop screen.<br>
Such "brightness flash" may last about 5 seconds if not about 7.5 seconds.
This brightness flash would still be felt even if I try to control the screen's brightness from buttons in the back of it (which isn't comfortable for me and takes more time than adjusting it from the operating system).<br>
Before several years I shifted from working primarily from a desktop to primarily from a laptop and since then I have lost my habit to adjusting brightness from buttons of any desktop screen, to the habit of adjusting brightness from an operating system.<br>
Recently I got back to work primarily from a desktop I can readjust myself to change brightness from a desktop screen but in my current screen it's not comfortable for me and anyway I prefer to do it from the operating system in general even in a desktop computer because from my experience it's just **faster** to do from an operating system thus reducing overall time of experiencing a "brightness flash" at night.

I can't understand why would either Microsoft and/or Screen manufacturers cause the problem of not letting a user adjust brightness from the operating system.<br>
Will buying a new screen help and what should be a sole feature of such a screen to allow controlling its brightness from Windows 11?<br>
I am not asking for a recommendation for any particular screen model or product, just to understand if the problem is in Windows, my current screen or both.

The Windows built-in brightness slider doesn't support external monitors. [Microsoft recommends instead](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-screen-brightness-in-windows-3f67a2f2-5c65-ceca-778b-5858fc007041#:~:text=an%20external%20monitor.-,To%20change%20the%20brightness%20on%20an%20external%20monitor%2C%20use%20the,slider%20to%20adjust%20the%20brightness.) to use the buttons on the monitor to do it:

> You might not see the Brightness slider on desktop PCs that have an external monitor. To change the brightness on an external monitor, use the buttons on it.

You can try some 3rd party app that adds such functionality, like [**Monitorian**](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/monitorian/9NW33J738BL0?hl=en-us&gl=us&activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab) or [**Twinkle Tray**](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/twinkle-tray-brightness-slider/9PLJWWSV01LK?hl=en-us&gl=us).

Another thing you may want to look into, is turning On Windows Night Light which should help the light be a bit less brutal.

Up until some time ago, not a lot of monitors supported the DDC/CI standard for sending/setting this via software.<br>
Yet, internal displays always did since they didn't have another way to change it, lacking dedicated physical buttons
