When people say I am from country X they actually mean that they were born in the territory of a certain group of people that would generally recognize one another as one of that group.
 I dont represent any country or group besides myself so if you think that a name of a country will tell you something about my personality, thats wrong.
I can tell you the term that the group members amongst I was born currently use to describe their territory, but, if you really want to know me myself you should ask me other questions

I lived in Thailand in the past. 
I speak a bit of Thai including reading and writing.

Where are you from? Or, you come from country what? Are bad ways to start a conversation because some people such as myself do not represent the tribal territory in which they were born in and do not share the culture common in this tribal territory.
Surely I can tell you the name of the tribe which in its territory I was born and you could also tell it to your friends to describe me, but thats not something I would start a conversation about because I believe it can lead to wrong assumptions about an individual person.

I was born in the territory controlled by those who will generally recognize one another as X.

The question "where are you originally from" is based on the wrong assumption that I have a country, but I don't have a country.
I don't represent any country.
My culture is of myself, not of a country.
I a man of a world, coming from earth, from humanity, from my parents, not from a country.
